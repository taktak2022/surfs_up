# surfs_up
## Module 9 SQLAlchemy SQLite and Flask

### Overview
This lesson had us planning a Surf & Ice Cream shop venture on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.  You have an interested investor named W.Avy who shares your love of surfing and ran a similar venture in the past, however his did not succeed due to unforseen circumstances which were mostly bad-weather realted.  If he is to invest in this current venture, we need to analyze weather trends on Oahu to the best of our ability to ensure a successful business future.  We start with data from August 23, 2017 which happens to be W.Avy's favorite day.  It was the first day he ever went surfing...and he also had ice cream on the same day.

### Analysis and Results
We started by plotting the precipiation over a period of one year from August 24, 2016 through August 23, 2017.  the following plot chart shows possible weather trends over that year for all of the weather observation stations.

We continued out analysis by focusing on all of the daily recorded temperatures for only months of June from years 2010 through 2017.  The following statistical summary was determined as follows:

Hawaii's average temperature, especially for a summer month with a max of 85 degrees is understandable and even expected.  The mean of 74.9 degrees and minimum of 64 degrees may be due to the locations of the observations stations.  It is not typical for June on Oahu.  A minimum temperature of 64 degrees can only be found in the higher elevations of the Koolau or Waianae ranges on Oahu, which tend to cool off the warmer air and moisture.  This also explains the green mountain ranges you see in pictures.

Not surprisingly the Surf and Ice Cream shop will start off in a location frequented by tourists and locals alike.  Having grown-up in Hawaii, I know the most logical location(s) would be near Waikiki, Ala Moana, the North Shore/Haleiwa areas or the newly developed Ko Olina resort area where the fairly new Disney Aulani Resort as well as the Four Seasons Resort is located.  The average temperatures in these areas are more consistent with the max temperature of 85 degrees, with the average temperature throughout the year in the 80's.

We compare the June temperatures with those of the same period but for the months of December only which are determined as follows:

From this statistical summary, we see again, even in December - a winter month can have a max temperature range of 83 degrees.  The mean of 71 degrees is consistent with the cooler weather patterns for the winter months.

For further comparison, I ran two other statistical summaries for the months of March and September for the same years.  March is as follows:

Here too, we see the spring months of March with a max of 82 degrees and a mean of 70 degrees.  This variation, I believe is dependent on where the actual location of the observation stations are located.  Did you notice that the mean for the months of March is actually cooler than the mean of the months of December?
The months of September is as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99851509/168522816-6987f461-a6b6-4d03-8fc6-17d9c4021186.png)

The mean of 76 degrees during the September months, an autumn month are higher than those of June, a summer month.  When we look at the max temperatures for September we see that is higher as well, with a max temperature of 87 degrees.  These temperatures bode well for the Surf and Ice Cream business as the warmer temperatures year round will entice customers to "cool off" either by hitting the waves and/or getting a tasty cold treat.

### Summary
Although the data tells a lot about the possible weather patterns, there were two things missing from the whole process of which I partially mentioned above.  The first is the actual location(s) of the observation stations.  Not knowing where they are located, even in a general sense (i.e. along the ocean, up in the mountains, at the airport, etc.) can tell you a lot about the weather as well.  If the observations stations are only giving data about precipitation and temperatures from the mountain areas of Oahu, then further analysis will be needed if you are considering opening up a Surf and Ice Cream shop near the ocean.

In Hawaii, it can be raining on one side of the island and be perfectly sunny on the other.  This is typical for the "Windward" side of Oahu, namely Kailua and Kaneohe which tend to get more rain as they are located against the Koolau mountain range which traps moisture from the sea.  The other factor that should have been part of this analysis which plays a huge part in the weather patters of Hawaii is HUMIDITY.  Humidity can make a cooler 77 degree day feel like it is 85 degrees.  Humidity or moisture in the air can lead to sweat not evaporating on a person's body which raises your skin temperature.  This is great for selling ice cream, but can be inversely challenging to keep ice cream cold enough to be welcoming for customers.  This information can provide more insight on the equipment, regular maintenance and supply chain logistics for the ice cream in particular.
